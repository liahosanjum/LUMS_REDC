The subprime phenomena have raised some very poignant questions about the ability or, all too frequently the inability of corporate giants to manage their risk.

There will be no refund for cancellation received after the withdrawal date or in case of no-show.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is possible to transfer to another programme within 2 years.

Although the level of technology sophistication varies across most industries, the magnitude of human intervention in running production floors and producing goods is considered significant across all. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, globalization and international competition demands from local industries to &lsquo;reduce time to market&rsquo;, &lsquo;cut down its costs&rsquo; and &lsquo;provide better value&rsquo; to customers on a continual basis.

Fundamentally, a brand&rsquo;s continuity depends on its ability to sustain itself. Regardless of your view of the world, your brand remains your company&rsquo;s most valuable asset that can help you sustain your business in turbulent times. Understanding how your brand creates value for you, is the key to maintaining market leadership or establishing it in the first place. We also continue to see a trend of increasingly sophisticated outlook on managing brands, and growing importance on understanding the drivers of brand value.&nbsp; Nowadays brands may represent invaluable intangible assets, creating and nurturing a strong brand poses considerable challenges. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharting the course for successful brand management requires a multifaceted perspective, even if it is delivered through one brand. A connected and holistic approach to brand management is prerequisite. While it is essential that companies establish distinctive brands in their marketing plans, they must also emphasize differentiation and trust when marketing the branded product. This is especially critical for companies selling intangible products because trust itself can be the most significant differentiator. Digital and media technologies have opened many new channels of communication and information, giving companies the opportunity to develop much closer relationships between their brands and their consumers. As a result, both companies and their brands have to establish the type of strong personality and confident attitude that can engage consumers, inspire trust, obtain advocacy, and sustain active interest and involvement. Hard evidence is critically important to any brand case, and an evidentiary overlay can be a tremendous asset in building and communicating a uniquely compelling brand position.</p>', '<p>The concept of customer based brand equity can provide marketers with valuable perspective and a common denominator to interpret the potential effects and tradeoffs of various strategies and tactics for their brands.

This helped the centre to establish its credibility and prove its effectiveness in achieving the objectives of these organizations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn important milestone in the history of REDC came in 1994 when a purpose-built facility sponsored by the Rausing family of Sweden was made to host courses offered by REDC. This year the centre also established a core team responsible to take the REDC to the next level. The team recruited professionals to manage various aspects of these courses that in turn helped the centre to become critical resource for the business community. In year 1994 REDC conducted its first course in collaboration with Commonwealth Secretariat, UK that attracted managers from countries who are part of Commonwealth community giving boost to REDC&rsquo;s image as a international executive development centre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nREDC in the last 18 years has established itself as a centre of excellence offering premier courses geared towards top, senior and upper middle managers from public and private sector.&nbsp;</p>', 'No', 7, 1, 'Y'),
